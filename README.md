## Overview

This project, part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations), was a practical exercise in DOM manipulation using CSS and JavaScript. While the project's user interface may not be visually polished, it successfully demonstrates effective DOM manipulation techniques.

## Description

- This is a simple rock-paper-scissors game.
- The user can play against the computer.
- The user can choose to play against a friend (Not yet implemented).
- The user plays in a best of 5 game.

## Building With

- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML

&nbsp;

## Highlights

- **DOM Manipulation**: The project extensively employs DOM manipulation to create a dynamic user experience, updating game states and results without requiring page reloads.

- **Efficient Game Logic**: I implemented efficient JavaScript logic to determine game outcomes accurately, considering the player's choice and the computer's randomized selection.

- **DRY Code**: Maintaining code DRYness was a bit of a challenge but I tried my best to minimized repetition by using functions and reusing code blocks. Feedback on further DRYness improvements would be valuable.

## Request for Feedback

I invite feedback on the project, particularly regarding code quality and DRYness. Although the UI is basic, I'm eager to refine my coding skills further.

## Conclusion

This assignment provided hands-on experience with DOM manipulation and JavaScript. While open to improvement, it serves as a testament to my growing proficiency in web development.

If you would like to review the code or provide feedback, please let me know, and I'll gladly share the relevant code files.
